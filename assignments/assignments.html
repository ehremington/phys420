<p>The “hint” in this problem probably needs another hint. Think about the fact that you can express <span class="math inline">\(N!\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(N\times (N-1)!\)</span>, and that means you can rearrange that formula to write <span class="math display">\[ (N-1)! = \frac{N!}{N} \]</span></p>
<p>Use a similar technique on <span class="math inline">\((q+N-1!)\)</span> and then simplify.</p>
<p>Also another hint for later on, don’t forget that <span class="math inline">\(N = N^1 = N^{2/2}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Your hint for this one is in part (d). The question asks, “Out of all the macrostates, what fraction have reasonably large probabilities?” What he is getting at is you have found in part (c) how tall the multiplicity peak is, and in part (b) you have found the area under the multiplicity curve so using the loose approximation of the area as a thin rectangle the width of that rectangle would correspond to the number of macrostates that have a reasonable change of occuring. The “fraction” that have a reasonable chance of occuring is just this number divided by the total number of macrostates. This will be a very small number. This small number represents the fraction of all the macrostates that are reasonably likely to occur.</p>

<p>I have already done this in jupyter, so just make sure you have added it to your personal version of that file and know how it works.</p>
<p>There is a question at the end of this problem that says, “Also compute the entropy over long time scales, assuming that all microstates are accessible.” What this means is that instead of plugging in the multiplicity of the of the most likely macrostate into the entropy formula, you are pluggin in the total multiplicity of all the macrostates. This is just the sum of the multiplicities of the macrostates.</p>
<p>Another way you can get this number is to think about the system as a <em>single</em> solid (of 500 particles) with a 100 packets of enery to share. What is the multiplicity of this single solid. This number is equal to the sum of the total multiplicities of the two solids in contact. Show yourself that this is true.</p>
<p>In jupyter to get this to work on the pandas dataframe that we made a couple of things may be handy. First, make sure your dataframe expresses all of its values as <em>float numbers</em> (which just means scientific notation) rather than <em>integers</em> which is so long your computer can not display it. To do this run something like this on your table (mine was called <code>table2</code>).</p>
<pre><code>table2 = table2.astype(float)</code></pre>
<p>Next, you can sum up the <code>multi_total</code> column using this function:</p>
<pre><code>table2[&#39;multi_total&#39;].sum()</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1.36">Problem 1.36</h3>
<p>It might help to do 1.35 first but I’ll tell you the gist and then you can just use the results. We derived an expression in class for initial and final volume and temperature ratios for an adiabatic compression:</p>

<p>This is also the same information as equation 1.38 and 1.39 from the book. Use your proportionalities from the ideal gas law to get <span class="math inline">\(T\propto PV\)</span>, and then plug that in and simplify. You will get equation 1.40 from the book, as long as you let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = (f+2)/f\)</span>. Use this form to help with Problem 1.36.</p>
<h3 id="problem-1.38">Problem 1.38</h3>
<p>Great conceptual question. Think about which bubble with expand more, the one that experienced isothermal expansion, or the one that experienced adiabatic expansion. They experience the same change in pressure since they start at the same level in the water and both reach the surface.</p>

<h3 id="proportionality">Proportionality</h3>
<p>Proportionality is a very convenient way to summarize a relationship, but its the kind of thing that everyone assumes someone else taught you.</p>
<p>So when we see an equation like the ideal gas law <span class="math inline">\(P V = N k_B T\)</span> this equation contains many relationships that can be stated as <em>ratios</em>. As an example, imagine we are conducting an experiment where we vary the temperature of a gas, but we do not change the number of particles or the volume of the container. The question is what happens to the pressure? We can relate the <em>ratio</em> of the two temperatures to the <em>ratio</em> of the two different pressures. Here is how:</p>
<p>Solve for the Pressure:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P = \frac{N k_B}{V} T \]</span></p>
<p>and then see that this general equation must be satisfied in the specific instances of <span class="math inline">\(T_1, T_2, P_1, P_2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[ P_1 = \frac{N k_B}{V} T_1 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ P_2 = \frac{N k_B}{V} T_2 \]</span></p>
<p>Dividing the two equations as 2/1, shows that all of the constant things (<span class="math inline">\(N, k_b, V\)</span>) cancel out and we are left with a proportion</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\]</span></p>
<p>This type of proportionality is called <em>directly proportional</em> or <em>linearly proportional</em> since if you double the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_2/T_1 = 2\)</span> then the equation says that the pressure would double as well <span class="math inline">\(P_2/P_1 = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fancy/mathy way of writing this is <span class="math inline">\(P \propto T\)</span>. When you see that statement, it means you can write down <span class="math display">\[\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\]</span></p>
<p>Other types of proportionality follow from this logic. So for example</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y \propto \frac{1}{x} \]</span></p>
<p>is called <em>inverse proportionality</em>. It is also sometimes written as <span class="math inline">\(y \propto x^{-1}\)</span>. From these statements, you can write down</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{y_2}{y_1} = \frac{x_1}{x_2} = \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^{-1} \]</span></p>
<p>There are other proportionality statements that are very important in physics like the famous <em>inverse square law</em> which comes in the form <span class="math inline">\(y \propto x^{-2}\)</span>. These kinds of proportionality statements can also be written as an equation with a <em>constant of proportionality</em> which is often the mores familiar form to us. So for example the law of Universal Gravitation can be written like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \]</span></p>
<p>We could say the the force is directly proportional to each mass, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The constant of proportionality is <em>G</em>.</p>
<p>Ok, now go back to the ideal gas law and imagine the following scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>By what factor does the pressure change if the temperature triples (here we assume that all other things are unchanged)? (that language of “by what factor” is just another way of saying “whats the ratio of pressures”)</li>
<li>By what factors does the pressure change if the number of particles doubles? What about halving? (remember that this is only true if the temperature is the same as well as the volume - how would you do that?).</li>
<li>By what factor does the pressure change if the volume doubles?</li>
<li>By what factor does the pressure change if the volume doubles and the temperature triples?</li>
<li>By what factors would the temperature change if the volume doubled and the pressure tripled?</li>
<li>By what factors would the volume change if the number of particles halved and the pressure doubled and the temperature <em>decreased</em> by a factor of 10? How would you do this in the lab?</li>
</ol>
